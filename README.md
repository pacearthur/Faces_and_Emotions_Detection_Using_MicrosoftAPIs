# Faces and emotions detection using Microsoft Face API

This project, which is the result of a partnership between Capgemini and Microsoft, aims to analyse a population live during all types of events (conferences, debates, meetings, presentations...). It ranges from the simple characterization of this population with identity data, such as gender and age, to the individual measurement of emotions. This measure is divided into several parts and must be able to judge an overall feeling both on a global theme and on a particular sentence, remark, or punchline. The first basis of the targeted feelings is based on four emotions: joy, surprise, indifference and neutrality. This sentiment analysis is based on the use of Azure cognitive services, such as the Face API, and also the speech to text API. The restitution of this data must also be able to be visualized in real time in the form of a Dashboard with scalable graphs.
